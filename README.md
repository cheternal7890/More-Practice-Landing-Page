This project is for educational purposes on building a responsive website.

The heading fonts automatically adjusts depending on the size of the view port with the CSS clamp() function with a minimum and maximum font size.

The top header adjusts according to the max-width by switching to a mobile friendly layout. The header is also fixed, so no matter where you are the header stays at the top.

Technologies used: HTML, CSS, Chrome DevTools.
Hosted on Netlify: https://chatgpt-landing.netlify.app/
